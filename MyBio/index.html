        <img src="Kelsie.jpg" class="auth.image" alt="class picture">
        <p> My name is Kelsie Daniels and I am a freelance Video Editor 
            and a recent graduate of Georgia State University. I have worked
            on various video projects for organizations across Atlanta such as 
            Home Depot, Boys and Girls Club, AKA, and Ebenezer Baptist Church to 
            create promotional videos for upcoming business events. Feel free to take
            a look around at some of my professional and personal video work to see
            Atlanta through a whole new scope!
        </p>

        <p> In addition to being a freelance Videographer, I've also found ways to 
            showcase my hobbies online to create video content for everyone to enjoy! 
            I currently own an Instagram and YouTube page that I upoload weekly to where 
            I show off the power of creativity with things I enjoy doing everyday! Feel free 
            to look around my YouTube and Instagram page for yourself and see what I 
            mean!
